Welcome to Digital Design course group project,
Quine-McCluskey Logic Minimization Program

License: https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/

How to run:
-Enter any Boolean expression up to 10 variables 
-The program will then print all the steps in the Quine-McCluskey algorithm.

This repository contains the required files to run the Quine McCluskey, this is the explanation of each file:

.gitignore is the file that contains all paths which GitHub should ignore when modified so that the repository is clean.  
Digital finalllll.cpp contains an attempt to solve the the PI table and print the minimized Boolean expression of the Boolean function using
the 3-step heuristic
Implicant.cpp is the cpp of an object which simplifies the code by utilizing the object-oriented aspect of C++
Implicant.h is the header file of the Implicants class
LogicMinimization.cpp is the main file which contains the main function and contains all the functions
Project files.sln is the project file
Project files.vcxproj, Project files.vcxproj.filters, Project files.vcxproj.user are folders that assist the program references so that the project works correctly when directly cloned
